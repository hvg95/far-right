Populist 3.0
ParlGov.Org

(ATTEMPT 01)Populist: filtered to all parties with a far right value of one
Parl Gov: filtered out all European countries
Vlookup
Filtered (potential prob, using cases from 2023 but party lists ends in 2022)
Divided seats by seats total
Changed my mind
Sorted by country
Pulled vote share of most recent election a far right party ran in (as long as was in past 5 years)
Lost everything

(ATTEMPT 02)
Redownloaded populist and parl gov
Sorted/filtered Populist by Far right and far right BL, put into new spreadsheet tab
Sorted elections by later than 2000, Europe only
V lookup for right wing and bl
Sort
Now we have all elections where a right wing party ran
A problem again! Brexit party not showing up

(ATTEMPT 03)
Restarted 
Sorted elections by most recent, including all parties (2023 and further back until every country represented once)
Put most recent elections by party/country into new sheet 
VLookup for parties labelled as "far-right" or "far-right_bl" (borderline) on PopuList
Added vote share for each far-right party to get Total Vote Share for all far-right parties in each individual country
Repeated for elections in 2013 and further back (until every country represented)

Notes
Vote share data was missing for some parties in Hungary and Poland.  Divded the number of seats won by the total to get vote share for those parties.
Some parties did not have ParlGov ID numbers; assumed this meant they had not won a seat, so thus would be excluded anyway
ParlGov methodology for vote share is interesting- even parties that have won "0" seats can sometimes get a plus-0 number of the vote share...
